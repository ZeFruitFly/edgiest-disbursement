<td><b>Welcome to the First Whirled!</b>

<p> Whirled is a social online world for chat and multi-player games, powered
by player-created content. It is <a href="http://www.threerings.net/">Three
Rings'</a> next game, the follow-on to
<a href="http://www.puzzlepirates.com/">Puzzle Pirates</a> and
<a href="http://www.banghowdy.com/">Bang! Howdy</a>. With Whirled we are trying
to do something different -- in Whirled the players create the characters,
rooms and (in due course) the games. We hope that this will be a lot of fun for
everyone! </p>

<p> To get started, you should <a href="/index.html">head into the Whirled</a>. You
will need to login with your email address and the password you were
sent. Please then click "Me" -> "Account" and configure your Permaname which
will allow you to log into the <a href="http://forums.whirled.com/">Forums</a>
and the <a href="http://wiki.whirled.com/">Wiki</a>. You can access the Forums
and Wiki from the menu navigation in the Whirled once you've logged in. </p>

<p> We will be active on the forums and in the world so feel free to post
questions and comments there or say hello if you see us in Whirled. </p>

<p> Thanks again for coming and playing around with our very incomplete new
project. We look forward to seeing and playing with the cool stuff you
make. </p>
