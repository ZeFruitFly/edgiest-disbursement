<p>THE SERVICES AND CONTENT OF WHIRLED

<p>1.1 Basic description of the service: Whirled, a multi-user environment, including software and websites.

<p>"Whirled" is the multi-user online service offered by Grey Havens, including the software provided to you by Grey Havens (collectively, the "Grey Havens Software") and the online environments that support the service, including without limitation: the server computation, software access, messaging and protocols that simulate the Whirled environment (the "Servers"), the software that is provided by Grey Havens and installed on the local computer or other device you use to access the Servers and thereby view or otherwise access the Whirled environment (the "Client"), application program interfaces provided by Grey Havens to you for use with Whirled (the "APIs"), and access to the websites and services available from the domain and subdomains of http://whirled.com (the "Websites"). The Servers, Client, APIs, Websites and any other Grey Havens Software collectively constitute the "Service" as used in this Agreement.
<p>1.2 Grey Havens is a service provider, which means, among other things, that Grey Havens does not control various aspects of the Service.

<p>You acknowledge that Grey Havens is a service provider that may allow people to interact online regarding topics and content chosen by users of the service, and that users can alter the service environment on a real-time basis. Grey Havens generally does not regulate the content of communications between users or users' interactions with the Service. As a result, Grey Havens has very limited control, if any, over the quality, safety, morality, legality, truthfulness or accuracy of various aspects of the Service.
<p>1.3 Content available in the Service may be provided by users of the Service, rather than by Grey Havens. Grey Havens and other parties have rights in their respective content, which you agree to respect.

<p>You acknowledge that: (i) by using the Service you may have access to graphics, sound effects, music, video, audio, computer programs, animation, text and other creative output (collectively, "Content"), and (ii) Content may be provided under license by independent content providers, including contributions from other users of the Service (all such independent content providers, "Content Providers"). Grey Havens does not pre-screen Content.
<p>You acknowledge that Grey Havens and other Content Providers have rights in their respective Content under copyright and other applicable laws and treaty provisions, and that except as described in this Agreement, such rights are not licensed or otherwise transferred by mere use of the Service. You accept full responsibility and liability for your use of any Content in violation of any such rights. You agree that your creation of Content is not in any way based upon any expectation of compensation from Grey Havens.
<p>1.4 Whirled "currencies" are a limited license right available for purchase or free distribution at Grey Havens' discretion, and are not redeemable for monetary value from Grey Havens.

<p>You acknowledge that the Service presently includes a component of in-world fictional currencies ("Coins", "Bars", collectively known as "Whirled Currencies"), which constitute a limited license right to use a feature of our product when, as, and if allowed by Grey Havens. Grey Havens may charge fees for the right to use Whirled Currencies, or may distribute Whirled Currencies without charge, in its sole discretion. Regardless of terminology used, Whirled Currencies represent a limited license right governed solely under the terms of this Agreement, and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from Grey Havens at any time. You agree that Grey Havens has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Currency as it sees fit in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and that Grey Havens will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right.
<p>1.5 Whirled is subject to scheduled and unscheduled service interruptions. All aspects of the Service are subject to change or elimination at Grey Havens' sole discretion.

<p>Grey Havens reserves the right to interrupt the Service with or without prior notice for any reason or no reason. You agree that Grey Havens will not be liable for any interruption of the Service, delay or failure to perform, and you understand that except as otherwise specifically provided in Grey Havens' billing policies posted at http://wiki.whirled.com/Billing_FAQ, you shall not be entitled to any refunds of fees for interruption of service or failure to perform. Grey Havens has the right at any time for any reason or no reason to change and/or eliminate any aspect(s) of the Service as it sees fit in its sole discretion.
<p>1.6 In the event you choose to use paid aspects of the Service, you agree to the posted pricing and billing policies on the Websites.

<p>Certain aspects of the Service are provided for a fee or other charge. These fees and charges are described on the Websites, and in the event you elect to use paid aspects of the Service, you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to such fees and charges, posted or linked at http://wiki.whirled.com/Billing_FAQ. Grey Havens may add new services for additional fees and charges, or proactively amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in its sole discretion.
